# "Land on Vector Spaces"
## Practical Linear Algebra with Python

This learning module re-imagines the teaching of linear algebra with a visually rich, intuitive approach, enabled by computing with Python.
We disregard all the rules-based, memorization-heavy instruction of typical (undergraduate) courses in linear algebra.
Instead, we rely on visuals to elucidate the core concepts, and on computational thinking for applying those concepts to useful settings.

#### Lesson 1:
What is a vector? The physicist's view versus the computer scientist's view. Fundamental vector operations: visualizing vector addition and multiplication by a scalar. Intuitive presentation of basis vectors, linear combination and span. What is a matrix? A matrix as a linear transformation mapping a vector in one space, to another space. Visualizing linear transformations. Matrix-vector multiplication: a linear combination of the matrix columns. Some special transformations: rotation, shear, scaling. Matrix-matrix multiplication: a composition of two linear transformations. Idea of inverse of a matrix as a transformation that takes vectors back to where they came from.
