    "\n",
    "The first episode in the wonderful video series, [_\"Essence of Linear Algebra\"_](http://3b1b.co/eola) tells you of three different ideas about vectors [1]:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. For physicists, a vector is an \"arrow\" of a given length (magnitude) and direction. It can represent directional quantities like velocity, force, acceleration.\n",
    "2. For computer scientists, a vector is an ordered list of numbers. It can represent a set of variables or features stored in order.\n",
    "3. For mathematicians, vectors are generic objects that behave a certain way when they are added or scaled:  $\\vec{u}+\\vec{v}$, $\\alpha\\vec{v}$.\n",

    "\n",
    "In computer science and in data science, vectors are often multi-dimensional, that is, they have many components. They contain a set of ordered variables in a data model, like for example: the age, weight, daily hours of sleep, weekly hours of exercise, and blood pressure of an individual (five dimensions).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with the idea of a vector as an \"arrow\" (magnitude plus direction). We visualize a vector by placing this arrow with its tail at the origin of a coordinate system.\n",
